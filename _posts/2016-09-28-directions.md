**Disclaimer: This is going to be a rant.** 

I have a headache. I've been having lost of those lately. I suspect existential qualms are at the root of these symptoms. 

Backtrack. After a year of employment at a particular art gallery, I decided to hit the eject button and quit. That was the best decision I've made all year. It is also the most nerve-wrecking. Not knowing where my career is heading is very troubling. The problem is I'm being pulled in lots of different directions and haven't been able to dedicate my time to a single interest. Ultimately I know that I'm incapable of focusing on just one thing. My brain wanders and needs to occupy itself with a variety of interests that have enough spectrum to produce rainbow in at least 6 to 16-bit depth.
