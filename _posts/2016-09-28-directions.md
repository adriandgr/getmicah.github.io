**Disclaimer: This is going to be a rant.** 

I have a headache. I've been having lost of those lately. I suspect existential qualms are at the root of these symptoms. 

It's been a month and two days since I "launched" this blog and I still haven't written a single entry. So what's the hold up?

Backtrack. After a year of employment at an art gallery, I decided to hit the eject button and quit. That was the best decision I've made all year. No doubt about it. OK, but it also happens to be the most nerve-wrecking decision I've made since I decided to drop out of ComSci to pursue a degree in visual art. 

At the time I was simply following a passion (one of many), and ignoring the *What are you going to do for a living?* question. Not knowing where my career choices were taking me was part of the allure of pursuing an arts education. 

Today that very same questions has a very different internal resonance. All of a sudden, quitting my job and not knowing where my career is heading is very troubling. So what's changed? The problem is I'm being pulled in lots of different directions and haven't been able to dedicate my time to a single interest. Ultimately, I know that I'm incapable of focusing on just the ONE thing. My brain wanders and needs to occupy itself with a variety of interests that have enough light spectrum to produce rainbows in at least 6 to 16-bit depth detail.
