Code review for tinyApp assignment.  

Notes given by Dave during code review:
- use `temp/` directory to store local files instead listing them individually in the `.gitignore` file
- ensure there is a new line character at the end of all code files
- `require('dotenv')` as early as possible
- move dev-dependencies to regular dependencies or guard them while in production mode
- [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) as an alternative to dateformat
- look into app.listen and server.address api (for reporting the server address) domain configuration should be in `.env` file
- `app.set` is a server configuration (not a middleware) group them with other server configuration variables.
app.set is a configuration
- Good job on using `req.session.nowInMinutes`. Now go and research about why it's useful (session fixation attacks).
- emails **may not** be validated with regular expressions.
  - google: falsehoods programmers believe...
  - curated lists of falsehoods
  - email specification doc: RFC 822
- `if users()`
- why return false when you meant undefined
- you may give functions properties (they are objects)
- don't forget to `do { } while` when applicable. DRY code!
- `res.locals` in `app.use` read more about them. DRY code!
- Reduce you [cyclomatic complexities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity)... use `return` statements as guards.
- Religiously end line with every `{` and start line with `}`
- Watch out for using root level routes such as `GET /:username`. What if somebody's username is `urls`? route conflict with `GET /urls`. **Lesson:** users are intentionally or accidentally malicious. Guard for every edge case. 

bithound.... static code analysis

sonarqube, code quality tool

first, check if exists.
if it doesn't exist 404
ntp drift


should only delete if user is owner

401 on POST /urls

keep them at the top (the guards)

avoid for ( in loops)

always test for the true value.




check valid scheme such as ftp
