Working on this side project for an art school friend. He's looking to update his unruly wordpress site into something simpler and easier to manage. 

I combined an existing Tumblr CSS theme which he liked and transformed it into a Jekyll template. [Source code](https://github.com/adriandgr/ce-portfolio) and site content is hosted and served using GitHub pages. Given that he is not comfortable enough editing plaintext documents, I also paired it with Siteleaf's fantastic CMS platform that automatically pushes repo commits to GitHub using an intuitive visual interphase.

While preparing this project there were only two main site components that are interesting to examine.

## Self Generating Navigation

One of the main goals of this project was for it to be as low maintenance as possible while remaining flexible and configurable. This meant taking note of the available editing features of Siteleaf and taking advantage of this in the best way possible. In addition to adding a static page or post, the frontend interphase allows users to generate new Jekyll collections with the click of a button. 

The site navigation takes advantage of this feature by looping over all collections and excluding two built-in collections that did not need to be displayed `posts` and `uploads` (used by Siteleaf to store static assets)



```html
<!-- _includes/sidebar -->
<div id="sidebar" class="has_description">
  <a href="/" id="sidebar_title" title="Home">
    <h1>{{ site.title }}</h1>
  </a>

  <h6>*</h6>
  <ul>{% for collection in site.collections %}{% if collection.label == 'posts' %}{% elsif collection.label == 'uploads' %}{% else %}
    <li><a href="/{{ collection.label }}">{{ collection.label | capitalize }}</a></li>{% endif %}{% endfor %}
    <li><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li>
    <li><a href="/cv">CV</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>
```
