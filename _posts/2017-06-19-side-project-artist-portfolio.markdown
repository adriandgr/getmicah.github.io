Working on this side project for an art school friend. He's looking to update his unruly wordpress site into something simpler and easier to manage. 

I combined an existing Tumblr CSS theme which he liked and transformed it into a Jekyll template. [Source code](https://github.com/adriandgr/ce-portfolio) and site content is hosted and served using GitHub pages. Given that he is not comfortable enough editing plaintext documents, I also paired it with Siteleaf's fantastic CMS platform that automatically pushes repo commits to GitHub using an intuitive visual interphase.
