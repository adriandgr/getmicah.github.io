**TL;DR** I'm making another attempt at writing a blog. I'm keeping things simple using Micah Cowell's [Basic Jekyll theme](https://github.com/getmicah/getmicah.github.io)

*Updated 16.09.28:* Haven't been able to wrap my head around a proper introductory post. I'm going to skip this for now and come back to it when I have a better idea where this is headed.

*Updated 17.03.13:* This is the six month mark of my micro-blog site. For the time being I'm using it as an online notebook / study tool to help me map out my web dev journey. As I gain more experience, the entries should become more interesting for people other than myself.
