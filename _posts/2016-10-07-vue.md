**TL;DR:** I deployed my first [Vue](http://vuejs.org/guide/installation.html) boilerplate app [here](http://fewblocks.ca/vue/).

# Which Framework?

Okay, so I want to learn a JS frontend framework. I've got years of experience with static HTML sites and decent CSS skills. I've also got a solid theoretical understanding of many frameworks out there. There's a lot of buzz pointing towards React as the view component of the MVC cycle. However there's something about it which continues to repel me every time I try to pick it up. On the other hand, there's something about Vue which seems to keep pulling me back even though it's not the most popular one.

I'm going to stick with it for a bit and see what comes out of it.
