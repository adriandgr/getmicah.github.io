Hello world. I'm a web-developer-in-training / artist.

# What do you do?
I like to learn different web technologies. I'm on [Github](https://github.com/adriandgr).

# What programming languages do you use?
When making static sites I like to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I have a strong interest in data-driven dynamic websites. I recently started learning Javascript and [Express](https://expressjs.com/). I've encountered Python, Java, and Objective C along my code adventures.
